Quick-reference for AI coding agents and human contributors working in this repo.

## What this repo is

Agentic Delivery OS is a spec-driven software delivery system: a team of AI agents and commands that turn a ticket into a reviewed, tested PR through a deterministic 10-phase workflow.

The agents and their prompt definitions (`.opencode/agent/*.md`, `.opencode/command/*.md`) **are the product**. A degraded prompt degrades everything downstream — treat them with the same rigor as production code. The delivery process is used to deliver improvements to itself.

> **New to ADOS?** See [doc/guides/onboarding-existing-project.md](doc/guides/onboarding-existing-project.md) or run `/bootstrap` to get started.

## Delivery process

Every change flows through 10 phases. `@pm` orchestrates; phases are gated but can be reopened when gaps are discovered.

| Phase | Agent | What happens |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 1. clarify_scope | `@pm` | Read ticket via MCP, cross-check against system spec (`doc/spec/**`), STOP if questions |
| 2. specification | `@spec-writer` | Create `chg-<ref>-spec.md` (problem, goals, AC) |
| 3. test_planning | `@test-plan-writer` | Create `chg-<ref>-test-plan.md` (traceable to AC) |
| 4. delivery_planning | `@plan-writer` | Create `chg-<ref>-plan.md` (phased tasks) |
| 5. delivery | `@coder` | Execute plan phases, commit per phase |
| 6. system_spec_update | `@doc-syncer` | Reconcile `doc/spec/**` with implementation |
| 7. review_fix | `@reviewer` | Audit vs spec/plan; if FAIL → `@coder` remediates → re-review |
| 8. quality_gates | `@runner` | Build/test/lint; if failures → `@fixer` → re-run |
| 9. dod_check | `@pm` | Verify all AC met, all plan tasks done |
| 10. pr_creation | `@pr-manager` | Create PR, assign to human, STOP |

## Agent team

### Orchestration
- `pm` — orchestrate changes; manage tickets via MCP; never implements code
- `decision-advisor` — decisions of all types (architecture, product, business, technical, operating); decision record authoring (ADR/PDR/TDR/BDR/ODR) _(formerly `architect`)_

### Decision review
- `decision-critic` — independent, read-only decision challenger; tri-state verdict (PASS / PASS_WITH_RISKS / REWORK)

### Onboarding
- `bootstrapper` — automate ADOS adoption for existing projects

### Artifact creation
- `spec-writer` — author change specifications
- `plan-writer` — author implementation plans
- `test-plan-writer` — author test plans with traceable coverage

### Implementation
- `coder` — execute plan phases; delegates to `@designer`, `@decision-advisor`, `@committer`, `@runner`
- `designer` — visual design and UI implementation
- `editor` — content rewrites and translations

### Verification
- `review-feedback-applier` — classify and apply accepted review feedback from PR/MR
- `reviewer` — review changes against spec, plan, code quality heuristics, and repo rules (local + remote modes)
- `fixer` — reproduce failures and apply targeted fixes
- `runner` — execute commands, capture logs (subagent)

### Documentation & release
- `doc-syncer` — reconcile system docs with completed changes
- `meeting-organizer` — prepare agendas and summarize meeting docs
- `committer` — create one Conventional Commit
- `pr-manager` — create/update PR/MR; enrich with ticket context via MCP

### Specialized
- `external-researcher` — research external sources via MCP
- `image-generator` — generate AI images via text-to-image CLI
- `image-reviewer` — analyze images, screenshots, and visual artifacts
- `toolsmith` — create and tune agents, commands, and skills

## Using the system

**Autopilot** (recommended) — `@pm` orchestrates all 10 phases:

```
@pm deliver change GH-456
```

**Manual** — you trigger each step:

```
/plan-change → /write-spec <ref> → /write-test-plan <ref> → /write-plan <ref>
→ /run-plan <ref> → /sync-docs <ref> → /review <ref> → /check → /pr
```

Guide: [doc/guides/opencode-agents-and-commands-guide.md](doc/guides/opencode-agents-and-commands-guide.md)

## Extending the system

When adding or modifying agents, commands, or skills:

- **Delegate to `@toolsmith`** — it specializes in prompt engineering, model-format-aware design, and quality gates for OpenCode tooling. Do not hand-edit agent/command files directly.
- **Tune related tools together** — agents hand off to each other; changing one agent's output format can break another's input. Check upstream inputs and downstream consumers.
- **Test through the delivery process** — run modified agents on a real change to validate.
- **Update [.opencode/README.md](.opencode/README.md)** when adding, removing, or renaming tools.
- **Keep prompts tight** — verbose prompts waste tokens and reduce quality; prefer XML structure for Claude models.
- **Model configuration is separate** — models are assigned in `opencode*.jsonc` config files, not in agent definitions. Agent files describe behavior; config files define which model runs them.

## Change artifacts

Changes are identified by `workItemRef` (`GH-456` for GitHub, `PDEV-123` for Jira).

```
doc/changes/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD--<workItemRef>--<slug>/
  ├── chg-<workItemRef>-spec.md
  ├── chg-<workItemRef>-plan.md
  ├── chg-<workItemRef>-test-plan.md
  └── chg-<workItemRef>-pm-notes.yaml
```

Branches: `<type>/<workItemRef>/<slug>` (e.g., `feat/GH-456/some-feature`)

### Profile-aware documentation safety

Before creating new documentation areas, agents should inspect `doc/documentation-profile.md` when present.

- If missing, assume `engineering-repo` behavior.
- If present but malformed, unparseable, missing required fields, or contains conflicting write roots, treat the repository as `engineering-repo` (business docs disabled) and ask the user to fix the profile before proceeding; do not guess which root wins.
- Do not create `doc/business/**` content unless profile enables it or the user explicitly requests a profile change.
- Prefer linking to a canonical strategy repository instead of writing business docs into implementation repositories.

Detail: [doc/guides/unified-change-convention-tracker-agnostic-specification.md](doc/guides/unified-change-convention-tracker-agnostic-specification.md)

### Doc distribution marker (`ados_distribution`)

Every distributable document declares its distribution class via an `ados_distribution` frontmatter marker, so the local install set (`scripts/install.sh`) and the CI drift guard (`scripts/.tests/test-doc-distribution.sh`) derive it automatically — instead of a hand-maintained allowlist.

- Any **new or changed doc** under `doc/guides/`, `doc/templates/` (incl. `blueprints/` and `*.yaml`), or the standalone docs (`doc/documentation-handbook.md`, `doc/00-index.md`, `doc/decisions/README.md`, `doc/decisions/00-index.md`, `.ai/rules/README.md`) **MUST** declare `ados_distribution` with one of: `redistributable` | `internal` | `project-generated`.
  - `.md` files: the key goes inside the **existing** frontmatter block (never add a new `---` block or a license header for it).
  - `.yaml` register templates: the key is a **top-level line 1** (no `---` block — it would create multi-doc YAML and break `yaml.safe_load()` consumers).
- A change that ships a `redistributable` doc **MUST** pass `bash scripts/.tests/test-doc-distribution.sh` (wired into CI; blocks merge on drift).

Canonical values: see `doc/decisions/ODR-0001-classify-yaml-register-templates-redistributable.md`.

## `tools/` and `scripts/` conventions

| Aspect | `tools/` | `scripts/` |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| Purpose | PATH-able CLI utilities for use beyond this repo | Repo-internal automation |
| Extension | No `.sh` — invoked by name (e.g., `tools/my-tool`) | `.sh` required |
| Tests | `tools/.tests/test-<tool-name>.sh` | `scripts/.tests/test-<script-name>.sh` |

## Running tests

Test files follow the pattern `test-*.sh` inside `.tests/` subdirectories. Run with `bash <dir>/.tests/test-*.sh`.

## License headers

**AI agents must never add license headers.** Headers are managed exclusively by `scripts/add-header-location.sh` for specific paths.

### Where headers are required

The script adds headers only to files that are installed when users onboard ADOS:
- `.opencode/agent/` — agent definitions
- `.opencode/command/` — command definitions
- `doc/guides/` — reusable guides
- `doc/documentation-handbook.md` — documentation handbook
- `tools/` — CLI utilities

### Where headers are NOT required

- `doc/changes/` — change artifacts (spec, plan, test-plan, pm-notes) are temporary working files
- `doc/decisions/` — decision records are project-specific
- `doc/planning/` — internal planning notes
- `.ai/` — configuration and ephemeral state

## Multi-tool support

ADOS maintains a **single source of truth** for all agent/command definitions:

- **`.opencode/`** — Canonical source (OpenCode format)
- **`.ados-claude/`** — Generated Claude Code plugin (committed, kept in sync by CI)

### Generated plugin rule (important)

**Never hand-edit `.ados-claude/` files.** They are generated artifacts.

If you need to change an agent, command, model assignment, tool access, or Claude Code plugin behavior:

1. Edit the source in `.opencode/agent/*.md` or `.opencode/command/*.md`
2. Update `scripts/build-claude-plugin.sh` only if the transformation itself must change
3. Run `scripts/build-claude-plugin.sh`
4. Commit the `.opencode/` source change and regenerated `.ados-claude/` output together

Generated `.ados-claude/**/*.md` files include comments naming their source file and regeneration command. Treat those comments as authoritative.

### When modifying agents or commands

1. Edit only `.opencode/agent/*.md` and `.opencode/command/*.md`
2. Run `scripts/build-claude-plugin.sh` to regenerate the Claude Code plugin
3. Commit both source and generated files together
4. CI verifies the generated plugin is current (fails if stale)

### Tool-specific frontmatter

Agent and command files support optional frontmatter keys for different tools:

```yaml
---
description: <agent description>
mode: all                    # OpenCode-specific
claude:                      # Claude Code-specific
  model: opus                 # opus | sonnet | haiku
---
```

OpenCode ignores the `claude:` key. Claude Code uses `claude.model` for model assignment.

### Adding new tools

See [doc/guides/adding-tool-support.md](doc/guides/adding-tool-support.md) for the extensibility pattern.

### How to add headers

Run the script on configured paths:

```bash
scripts/add-header-location.sh .opencode/agent
scripts/add-header-location.sh doc/guides
```
